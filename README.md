✅ GroupSlugRouter v2.1 – Final Summary
The GroupSlugRouter module adds vanity URLs and a profile group overview tab to OSSN, while staying fully compatible with core components.

🔧 Key Features
📍 Vanity URLs for Groups
Automatically generates clean, readable URLs (slugs) like:
https://yourdomain.com/g/your-group-name

Redirects /g/slug to /group/guid seamlessly.

Uses ossn_add_entity() to store the slug safely without touching the database schema.

Ensures unique slugs, even if titles conflict (e.g., group-name, group-name-1, etc.)

👥 User Profile Group Overview
Adds a new tab /u/username/groups showing all groups a user manages.

Sort options: Newest, Oldest, A–Z, Z–A, Most members.

Option to show or hide group cover images.

Each group shows both its default and vanity URL if available.

🔁 Slug Lifecycle Management
Slugs are automatically generated when a group is created.

On module activation, all existing groups without a slug receive one retroactively.

If a group title changes, the old slug is cleaned up and a new one generated.

On module deactivation, all slug entities (groupslugname) are removed for safety.

🛠️ Admin Debug Page
/slugdebug for manual testing of slugs (only visible to admins).

⚠️ Module Conflict Check
Automatically detects if the legacy UserGroups component is still active.

Warns the admin and prevents activation to avoid feature overlap.

💬 Feedback-Inspired Improvements
✅ Avoids unnecessary group lookups when resolving slugs — per community feedback:
“No need to load full group objects for redirects, just fetch the GUID and let OSSN handle it.”

✅ Safe entity deletion logic added in disable.php using ossn_delete_entity() — fully cleaned up on uninstall.

✅ Visual OSSN admin messages on enable/disable.

✅ Translated UI for both Dutch 🇳🇱 and English 🇬🇧.
